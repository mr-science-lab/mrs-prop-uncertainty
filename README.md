# MRS-Prop-Uncertainty Repository
Welcome! This repository replicates the primary analysis from our work on **Uncertainty Propagation in Absolute Metabolite Quantification for In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in the Human Brain.** Here, you'll find scripts, test data, and relevant project source code.  If you have any comments or questions, please feel free to email me directly at ronald.instrella@columbia.edu.

**Corresponding Author**: Ronald Instrella, Columbia University.

## Overview
The effect of measurement errors from experimentally-derived parameters in MRS absolute quantification are examined using both analytical derivations and Monte Carlo simulations. The following scripts and utility functions allow users to reproduce published figures, and run the analysis using custom values in the provided JSON configurations.

**Note:** This work is still under internal review, and thus will be released at the time of publication.
