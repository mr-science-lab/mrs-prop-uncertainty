# MRS-Prop-Uncertainty Repository
Source code related to my Ph.D. work on uncertainty and precision in MR spectroscopy. Corresponding author: Ronald Instrella, Columbia University.

## Overview
Welcome! This repository replicates the primary analysis from our work on **Uncertainty Propagation in Absolute Metabolite Quantification for In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in the Human Brain.** Here, you'll find scripts, test data, and relevant project source code.  If you have any comments or questions, please feel free to email me directly at ronald.instrella@columbia.edu.

**Note:** This work is still under internal review, and thus will be released at the time of publication. Stay tuned. :)
